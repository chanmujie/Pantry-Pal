this will make the biscuits heavy and tough.\\non a floured surface, pat out the dough and fold it over on itself. pat it out again and fold it over on itself again. pat out one more time to 1/2\" thick and cut with a 2\" biscuit cutter.\\nplace biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet and bake @ 425 on the top rack for 14 minutes.\\nfreezing instructions:\\nonce the biscuits are cut, place them on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the freezer.\\nonce the biscuits are frozen, remove from the baking sheet, place in a ziplock bag, and freeze for up to 3 months.\\nto bake frozen biscuits:\\nplace biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet, and bake at 475 degrees for 8 minutes - at 8 minutes they\\'ll look half-baked, that\\'s ok. do not open the oven door.\\nturn the oven off and leave the biscuits in the oven for another 5 to 10 minutes, until they\\'re golden brown.'}\n",
